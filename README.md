## **📑 Overview**
These are scripts for the [SinusBot][sinus].<br>
They were made on request.

We collect them in a general repository because they are not published to the [SinusBot][sinus] forums.

You can still use them if you want but there won't be further instructions or any information about the installation as well as the usage. The scripts also won't be updated as regularly unless the user who requested it wants it or we have some free time to do so.


## **🐍 Scripts**
- join-info
  - requested by: nongbookza12

- support-lock
  - requested by: tomislav
  - opens and closes a configurable support channel if atleast one member of configurable supporter groups is online


## **📕 History**
Users want to customize their [TeamSpeak] servers on daily basis and the [SinusBot][sinus] offers a pretty good scripting API to automate mostly anything.

Since not everyone is a programmer, we create scripts on user requests.

Sometimes users have a really specific wish or request or maybe we want to create a script for our personal use which doesn't really have huge demand.<br>
In these cases, we store these scripts in this repository instead of creating a new one for each of them.

This keeps everything tidy and prevents repository spam.


## **🤷‍♂️ Own Scripts**
In case you also want a specific script, you can request one on our [Discord server][discord].

The price depends on the complexity and the effort that we need to spend on the project.
